"""Shared state schema for the Vicinity agent graph.

This TypedDict is the single contract between all four agents
(Chat, Organizer, Search Supervisor, Report Generator) and the
graph routing logic. Every node reads from and writes to this state.

Design decisions:
  - messages uses add_messages reducer: LangGraph's built-in message
    accumulator that handles HumanMessage, AIMessage, ToolMessage
    deduplication and ordering.
  - sub_agent_result is a plain dict, NOT appended to messages.
    Sub-agent internal tool calls stay inside the sub-agent. Only
    the final result dict propagates to the Chat Agent for synthesis.
    This prevents context window blowup from parallel scoring results.
  - user_context is loaded once at session start (profile, bookmarks,
    summaries) and passed through unchanged. Agents read it but only
    the Organizer writes back to Snowflake.
  - pending_confirmation holds the Organizer's write preview payload.
    Written by organizer_plan (state commits on normal return).
    Read by organizer_confirm (calls interrupt() with this payload).
    Includes the original tool_calls list so the exact operation the
    user approved can be reconstructed after interrupt() resumes.
  - All config-driven limits (max tool calls, timeouts) are read from
    config/agents.yml at graph construction time, not stored in state.
